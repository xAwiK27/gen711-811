## Before lab begins
1. Open up vscode
2. Control + shift + 'p' to open command prompt (command + shift + p on apple)

4. If asked, connect to 'ron.sr.edu host'
5. Enter your RON username if prompted
6. Enter your RON password when prompted
7. Go to 'File --> Open folder'
8. Select your 'gen711-811' directory
9. If you haven't done so already, save your workspace to this directory (File --> save directory as --> enter)
10. Take your notes in 'Markdown' format. See the readme.txt for taking notes for this lab below. 

# Part 1 (lab 3)
### Questions:
- What is a command shell and why would I use one?
- How can I move around on RON?
- How can I see what files and directories I have?
- How can I specify the location of a file or directory on my computer?

### Objectives:
- Describe key reasons for learning shell.
- Navigate your file system using the command line.
- Access and read help files for bash programs and use help files to identify useful command options.
- Demonstrate the use of tab completion, and explain its advantages.

## The key points here are:
- The shell gives you the ability to work more efficiently by using keyboard commands rather than a GUI.
- Useful commands for navigating your file system include: ls, pwd, and cd.
- Most commands take options (flags) which begin with a -.
- Tab completion can reduce errors from mistyping and make work more efficient in the shell.

# Navigating Files and Directories
- How can I perform operations on files outside of my working directory?
- What are some navigational shortcuts I can use to make my work more efficient?

# Part 2 (lab 3)
## Objectives:
- Use a single command to navigate multiple steps in your directory structure, including moving backwards (one level up).
- Perform operations on files in directories outside your working directory.
- Work with hidden directories and hidden files.
- Interconvert between absolute and relative paths.
- Employ navigational shortcuts to move around your file system.

## More navigation
- We got an idea for moving around using cd and the name of the folder to move into. 
- But how to we go back out? We dont see the folder we are in.
- We have a special command to tell the computer to move us back or up one directory level.

### Your Notes Here: 
Seperate notes by an empty line, or they'll get pasted together

- Using a dash is helpful for lists
1. And numbers for lists

The pound sign is used for 'sections'. A single pound (or hashtag) in front of a word makes it appear bigger/bold to show a new section. See below

# My Notes:

To change directories, use 'cd' and then hit tab two times to see directories in my current directory
